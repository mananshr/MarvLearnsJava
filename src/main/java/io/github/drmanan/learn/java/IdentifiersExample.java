    The general rules (of thumb) for naming variables are:
    - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
    - Names must begin with a letter
    - Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
    - Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
    - Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
    - Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names

    // Good
    int minutesPerHour = 60;

    // OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
    int m = 60;

    // Check out Uncle Bob's book: Clean Code.
